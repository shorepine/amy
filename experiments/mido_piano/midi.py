"""Pared-down fork of Tulip midi.py.

piano_recital.py in the AMY repository is the dependant motivating the fork.

Forking avoids a dependency cycle and eliminates some opportunities for
confusion about the necessity of or assumptions about globals like midi config
and event handler.

`Queue` was removed in favor of the standard `collections.deque`, reflecting
the assumption that piano_recital.py will usually be run under CPython.
