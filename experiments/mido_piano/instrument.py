"""Piano MIDI sound module based on AMY and `mido`.

Example usage:

```
piano = instrument.Piano()
piano.play_file('test.mid')
```

Assumptions:
    * `amy.live()` and other setup are done external to this module.
    * Patch 256 is piano, and we will use 32 voices.
    * The `libamy` and `mido` packages are installed and supported by your
      platform. `python-rtmidi` is also useful for `play_input`.
    * You edited `#define AMY_OSCS` in amy/src/amy_config.h to have enough.
      (Enough is (32 * 21 == 672), which is the number of voices in `Piano`
      below times the number of oscs for the dpwe piano patch, except that
      there are chorus oscs and 999 and stuff, so why not go big?)
